										<h2><a href="#">CovImune</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/covimune.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Coded using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. CovImune is an all-in-one medical dashboard to analyse, store, remind and share medical data among all hospitals. With CovImune, every person can store all their medical records in one place, and subsequently share them with hospitals. It also has the added benefit of in-built analysers with alert and reminder facility. My project can redefine medical care and streamline the workflow in hospitals.</p>
									<p>I am soon to add more in-built analysers/predictors, and make the alerts & reminders functional.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Space Odyssey</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/odyssey.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This game is coded in C and is based on the famous board game called ‘Clue’. This is a complex text adventure games set in a virtual 3x3 map, where I set up all objects randomly. The player can move around and do a variety of stuff like picking up items or dropping them, searching up other commands, looking around, etc. with specific commands. One of the items, character and room will have to be guessed by the player so as to win the game.</p>
									<p>Main concepts used in this project include C structs, pointers, dynamic allocation with malloc/calloc, free'ing, and data structures and algorithms</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Santorini</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/santorini.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> This game is coded in C and is based on the famous board game ‘Santorini’. It consists of a 3x3 board in which we are allowed to move around the board as a player (and build levels) by entering the coordinates. I have also designed an AI in the game, which decides its position automatically based on the player’s input.</p>
									<p> Main concepts used in this project include basic data types, looping and conditional constructs, arrays, iteration, basic I/O, formatted output, and functions.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">WordFreak</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/wordfreak.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A simple yet, interactive project which can be used for a plethora of applications. The code is in C and is designed in such a way that it can take file input in any form, i.e, command-line arguments, environment variable or stdin/piping, and then it reads it, splits it [based on alpha characters], sorts it alphabetically, and then writes it to a new file along with the frequencies of each word.</p>
									<p> Main concepts used in this project include File I/O, environment variables, file descriptors, formatted I/O, argv & argc, pointers, structs, and data structures and algorithms.</p>

									<p>A program coded in C. It uses threads to simulate a debate, wherein callers will be queued automatically and simultaneously received by an operator, to enact the act of debate. This project can be used as a software to streamline the flow of calls in call centres, etc.</p>
									<p> Main concepts used in this project include threads, binary & counting semaphores, synchronization and pointers.</p>

									<p style="text-align:center">My first legally registered start-up, in India! We at QuickNotes focus on solving the common problems faced in the society such as lack of quality education. One way in which we do this is by enabling students to either upload their notes for free or purchase them at an extremely minimal cost of just 27 cents.</p>
									<p style="text-align:center">Our services [website still in production] will be released to the public by the end of September, 2021. We have a solid revenue model which allows QuickNotes to earn more than $220,000 in India alone, which converts to $990,000 in the US [according to Purchase Power Parity]. We have also hired students under our 'Quinternship' campaign. Moreover, we believe that every child needs to get access to education, hence we are also actively creating a business model to collaborate with NGO's and donate towards education for the unprivileged.</p>
